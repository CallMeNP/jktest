## 【释义】
Buddha, an 'Enlightened One', passim; Mvy 1 (and regularly) = Tib. saṅs rgyas; 35 Buddhas before whom serious offenses are to be confessed by Bodhisattvas, Śikṣ 169.4, see note. Many long lists of B's in most of the texts here included; in general, each name in such lists has been entered in my Dict. But one such list, Mmk 7.24-8.18, has been ignored; the text is very corrupt and obscure; division of the words is often uncertain; few of the names are known elsewhere, Five Buddhas called 'transcendent' by P. Mus, Barabudur, p. 577 ff. (L'origine des Cinq Jina; a full discussion here), Dharmas 3 et alibi, see the names Vairocana, Akṣobhya, Ratna-saṃbhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi.
